- In this project, We are going to leverage the power of Terraform and AWS to create an automated and consistent
deployment pipeline for web server on Amazon EC2 instances. This
project is an automation solution designed to simplify the
deployment of web server on AWS EC2 instances.

- This project aims to create a robust highly available web application
infrastructure using a two-tier architecture on Amazon Web Services
(AWS). The architecture comprises a web tier that handles user
requests and a database tier for data storage. I leveraged Terraform
for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to provision and manage AWS
resources efficiently.

## Project 5: Deploy a sample web server on ECS by using ECR pullthroughcache

![ecr_ecs drawio](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35014504-ecbc-42e5-8c80-99c43e76d781)
- This project deploys a sample web server using Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) with an ECR (Elastic Container Registry) pull-through cache, using Docker Hub as the upstream registry. The primary purpose is to showcase how using a pull-through cache can streamline container image retrieval, reduce Docker Hub rate limits, and improve deployment efficiency by caching images in AWSâ€™s regional ECR.

## Deploy AWS infrastructure resources by using terraform cloud VCS driven workflow

![diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56262507-2776-4647-b9a9-48516a7f9afd)
- This project deploys the AWS resources by using terraform with VCS driven workflow. It aims to understand about version control by using github and integrate between version control providers and terraform cloud in HCP (Hashicorp Cloud Platform).
- It is very similar with CICD workflow, terraform codes version control in github and store terraform statefiles in terraform cloud.
