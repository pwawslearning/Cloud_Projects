## Objective

This project demonstrates a streamlined deployment process of a web server in a containerized environment on AWS cloud.By using ECS, it runs a scalable, managed container instance in the cloud.The ECR pull-through cache reduces dependency on Docker Hub by caching images within the AWS region, minimizing latency, and ensuring a more reliable and faster deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

1. **AWS account**: For deployment ECS and ECR on AWS cloud.
2. **Install awscli and secret_key & access_key**: securely connect to AWS resources.
3. **Docker**: Docker hub account to pull public images.

## Architecture
- **AWS Secret manager** Create secret to connect with Docker hub by using access token.
- **IAM policy**: To pull image from upstream registry, the user who need to grant ECR registry permission.
- **ECR with Pull-Through Cache**: Configured to cache images from Docker Hub as an upstream registry. When ECS needs an image, it pulls from ECR rather than Docker Hub, unless the image isnâ€™t cached, in which case it fetches it once from Docker Hub.
- **Amazon ECS**: Manages the lifecycle of the containerized application. ECS orchestrates the deployment, scaling, and management of container instances.
- **Docker Hub (Upstream)**: The source for container images. The pull-through cache retrieves and stores images from Docker Hub on demand.
- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: Provides a secure network for ECS and ECR. ECS tasks run within private subnets, with necessary security group rules for inbound/outbound access.
- **Serverless**: For deployment container on compute instance which two instance types are EC2 and Fargate(serverless). In this process, use serverless instance(Fargate).

## Implementation
- **Create secret manager**
  - Create secret to connect with Docker by using dynamically token rotating.
- **IAM policy to user**:
  - Attach policy *AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess* to user who can pull images from docker hub to ECR registry.
- **ECR pull-through-cache feature**
  - Create an ECR repository with a pull-through cache rule, adding a new rule for specifying Docker Hub as the upstream.
  - Configure ECR permissions to allow ECS access for pulling images.
- **Pull image from upstream registry**:
  - Pull image from docker hub by aws cli as ECR provided pull commands.
- **Deploy web service on ECS**:
  - Create ECS cluster and defined instance type
  - Create task definition and configure container specifications.
  - Add ECS service under ECS cluster.
## Verification
- Go to task under ECS cluster >> public ip
- Access public ip on your web browser
  
## Clean up
- Destroy your created aws resources to save money.
